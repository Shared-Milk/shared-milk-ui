    bio: "I find that my curiosity for how things work, a love of problem solving, and creativity has led me to a career in technology. Up to my decision to pursue a career as a software engineer I spent most of the last decade entrenched in volunteer work with non-profit roller derby organizations looking to build a community of skaters and provide sporting entertainment. As a military spouse, I often led Soldier and Family Readiness Groups with the goal of distributing information, providing a social network, and building community in dynamic and generally stressful settings."
